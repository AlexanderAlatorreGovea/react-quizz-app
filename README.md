Code Review:

1. Reduce the lines of code you send for your pull requests. Limit it to
    isolated pieces of logic. 10-100 lines of code for code review.

2. Leave a good description about the code and good context. Add links to Asana. Add screenshot of before and after.

3. When part of the diff is different add a comment for your code reviewer.
If there is something in the pull request that is not super obvious give a pre-entive comment.

When reviewing code:

1. Leave really clear comments and make sure that you let them know if your suggestions can be made.

2. Stablish process on when to approve or not approve a pull request. Talk to your team about when to approve or dissaprove a pull request.

3. Talk to your teammate in person. I'll pin you online. Do not leave it on a pull request.
